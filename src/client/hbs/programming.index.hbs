<h3>Developer? Programmer? Coder? Hacker? Software Engineer?</h3>

<p>What's the difference? Is there one? In practice these terms are used mostly interchangably, but when describing my role I prefer to use either Hacker or Software Developer. I feel that these terms leave potential job flexible and do not focus on a specific activity--there are more limited positions that involve only programming or coding, but would like to do more. I formally studied Software Engineering, an academic discipline, and could fulfill that roll if put into it. In academia, resarch of actual engineering takes place but I have not encountered it in industry (probably due to pragmatic attitudes of most employers). Developer or Hacker then, are both sufficiently general terms. Software Developer is acceptable, Hacker is preferred.</p>
