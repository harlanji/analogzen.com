<h3>Motivation</h3>

	<p class="lead">
	I want to creatively present myself as a Human who writes programs, <abbr title="Expand Description Below">not simply a programmer</abbr>.

	<button type="button" class="btn btn-mini btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#moreMotivation">...</button>
	</p>

	<div id="moreMotivation" class="collapse">
		<blockquote>
			<p>The planter, who is Man sent out into the field to gather food, is seldom cheered by any idea of the true dignity of his ministry. He sees his bushel and his cart, and nothing beyond, and sinks into the farmer, instead of Man on the farm. The tradesman scarcely ever gives an ideal worth to his work, but is ridden by the routine of his craft, and the soul is subject to dollars. The priest becomes a form; the attorney, a statute-book; the mechanic, a machine; the sailor, a rope of a ship.</p>

			<p>In this distribution of functions, the scholar is the delegated intellect. <strong>In the right state, he is, Man Thinking.</strong> In the degenerate state, when the victim of society, he tends to become a mere thinker, or, still worse, the parrot of other men's thinking.</p>

			<p>-The American Scholar (Ralph Waldo Emerson)</p>

			<dt>Profile</dt>

			<dt>Portfolio</dt>
			<dd>A set of pieces of creative work collected by someone to display their skills, esp. to a potential employer.</dd>

<h3>Alternatives</h3>

	<p class="lead">LinkedIn or a flexible CMS system are the main alternatives, but the bigger goal of showcasing my web development skills took precedence.

	<button type="button" class="btn btn-mini btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#moreAlternatives">...</button>
	</p>

	<div id="moreAlternatives" class="collapse">
		<p>A <strong>LinkedIn</strong> profile presents information about past positions and projects, with human facotors delegated to a plain-text summary. I believe that cultural fit is at least as important as technical abilities.</p>

		<p>I could have used WordPress or another content engine (<strong>CMS</strong>), and produced an equivalent presentation. In this case I was personally motivated to learn a new technology stack, and this was a fitting application to for that purpose.</p>

		<p>I could have built the site with <strong>Another Web Framework</strong>, or written in any language. I chose NodeJS because it is an agile choice that is reaching maturity and has a lot of traction.</p>
	</div>

<h3>Features</h3>

	<!--
	<p class="lead">The first iteration includes: splash page; three recent projects with skills; and a printable resume.</p>
-->
	<p class="lead">Designed by and for a creative professional to convey a sense of individuality in an easy to understand way.

	<button type="button" class="btn btn-mini btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#moreFeatures">...</button>
	</p>

	<div id="moreFeatures" class="collapse">
		<ul>
			<li>Standard Splash page, highlighted projects, resume.</li>
			<li>A Philosophy behind the content design.</li>
			<li>A clean and minimal visual appearance.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Humans are complex and multi-dimensional, so the scope is potentially unlimited. My goal is to emphasize what I'm good at, but also challenge myself and leave from for growth as my as I change.</p>

	</div>
	

	<h3>Approach</h3>

	<p class="lead">I designed and built a portfolio based on articles and other portfolios that impressed me.
